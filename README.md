# fp-challenges

A set of functional programming challenges to solve.

* The list of challenges by date added are in the CHALLENGES.md file.
* The topic list we hope to cover are in the TOPICS.md file.
* We aim to keep these language-agnostic.
  * We suggest languages for the challenges. We focus more on the concepts rather than the specific language where we can.

For more information (including discussions/potential solutions to each problem) take a look at our wiki.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork the repository and begin working away at a problem!

Once you have a solution worked out, discuss it with others! See what they came up with and learn together.

## Submitting a new problem

If you would like to submit a problem: 

1. Fork the repository
1. Create a new directory with the date (format of YYYY-MM-dd)
1. Add a README which explains the goals of the challenge and explains how to run and test the code.
1. Add any files needed to get started (`index.js`, `Main.fsx`, tests, dependency files like `package.json`, etc).
1. Submit a PR with the label `enhancement` added. We will discuss and merge it in for others to enjoy!
