# Functional Programming Topics To Touch

The exact definition of functional programming, interestingly enough, isn't exact. It generally has to do with programming that interacts with functions (including creating and consuming functions). 
It can also overlap with topics like immutability, side-effects, type systems, declaritive techniques, along with others.

## Main goals

This list outlines what we aim to at least pass over through these challenges. We don't expect to cover these topics fully, but we will aim to make sure we have something that covers each of these.

* Higher-Order functions
* Pure versus Impure functions
* Side-Effects and removing side-effects
* Currying
* Partial application
* Composition
* Immutability
* Reading function type signatures (think `int -> int -> int` and `(a -> boolean) -> a list -> a list`)
* Designing with functional programming
* Unit Testing & FP
* Property-Based Testing & FP

## Aspirational goals

The topics beyond the 1st list are extensive. Here is a list of topics we are aspiring to cover. If nothing else, they are laid out here for your awareness and further research.

* Static type systems in FP languages
* Pattern matching
* Tuple type
* Discriminated Unions
* Functors
* Monads
